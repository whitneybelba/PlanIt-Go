## Login and Search
After a user logs in, he or she is able to search a US city that they would like to travel to, and pick the types of restaurants, bars and activities/sites that they would like to visit on their trip. After the app queries the Yelp API, the user is supplied with a list of options that relates to their preferences.  From there they can research and compare the options and decide which ones they would like to add to a trip/itinerary. Once the user has added all desired options, they can view their saved itinerary. Users are able search as many categories as they would like, add as many options as they would like to a trip, and save as many trips as they would like to their profile.
